#### Destilling statistically significant circumstances that promote the lethality of a car accident.

We use a GLM approach to find covariates that have a high influence on the odds of lethality in a car accident. We use a dataset of roughly 250000 recorded car accidents in the UK.

[Methodology](/AccidentsUK/Analysis.pdf) and [data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data)
